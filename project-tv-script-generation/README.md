# Deep Learning (PyTorch) from Udacity course

## TV Script Generator

* this project is an exercise to explore RNN / LSTM neural network capabilities

## Notebook Contents

* Data exploring

* Pre-processing and Tokenization

* Build neural network, define backpropagation

* Train neural network to desired loss

* Generate lots of non-sense text :)
